## Understanding User Lifecycle

### üÜï **The Journey from New Hire to Productive Team Member**

**Before They Arrive:**
Sometimes you'll get advance notice that someone new is joining:
- HR or managers send you basic information
- You can prepare their account and initial access
- Set up team assignments based on their role
- Plan what information and resources they'll need on day one

**First Day Setup:**
The goal is enabling immediate productivity:
- Account is ready when they arrive
- Login credentials work without hassle
- They can access basic tools and information right away
- Initial team connections are established

**First Week Growth:**
As they settle into their role, access needs become clearer:
- Additional permissions based on actual job responsibilities
- Access to project-specific resources and teams
- Connections to colleagues and collaboration tools
- Fine-tuning based on manager feedback and employee experience

**Ongoing Evolution:**
People's access needs change as they grow in their roles:
- Promotions requiring additional permissions
- Project assignments needing temporary access
- Role changes affecting team memberships
- Skills development opening new areas of responsibility

### üëã **The Departure Process**

**Planning for Transitions:**
When someone leaves, there's more to consider than just turning off their access:
- What work do they own that needs to be transferred?
- Who should take over their team responsibilities?
- Are there client relationships or project knowledge to hand off?
- What information should be preserved vs. removed?

**Secure and Respectful Departure:**
- Deactivate access promptly to maintain security
- Preserve important work and information appropriately
- Handle personal information with respect and privacy
- Coordinate with HR and management for smooth transition
