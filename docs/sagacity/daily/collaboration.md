5. **Introduce yourself** to new team members

### Understanding Your Role

## Communicating with Your Team

### Using Comments and Updates

**When to leave comments:**
- You complete a task that affects others
- You encounter a problem that impacts the project
- You have a question about someone else's work
- You want to share helpful information or resources

**How to write good comments:**
1. **Be specific:** "Budget review complete - approved with minor changes" not just "done"
2. **Tag relevant people:** Use @mentions to notify specific team members
3. **Include next steps:** "Task complete. Sarah, ready for your review."
4. **Be professional but friendly:** Maintain a positive, helpful tone

### @Mentioning Team Members

**When to use @mentions:**
- You need someone's attention on a specific task
- You're asking a question that only they can answer
- You're updating them on work that affects them
- You want to give them credit for their help

**How to @mention effectively:**
1. **Type @ followed by their name** (Sagacity will suggest matches)
2. **Be clear about what you need:** "@John Can you review this draft by Friday?"
3. **Don't overuse mentions** - save them for important communications
4. **Respond promptly** when someone mentions you

### Status Updates and Check-ins

**Daily stand-up style updates:**
Share brief updates about:
- What you completed yesterday
- What you're working on today  
- Any obstacles you're facing
- Help you need from others

**Project milestone updates:**
When you reach important project points:
- Mark milestones as complete
- Share what was accomplished
- Note any lessons learned
- Identify what's needed for the next phase

## Handling Task Handoffs

### Receiving Work from Others

**When someone assigns you a task:**
1. **Read all instructions** and attached files
2. **Check the deadline** and priority level
3. **Review any comments** from previous work
4. **Ask questions immediately** if anything is unclear
5. **Confirm you can meet the deadline**

**If you can't meet the deadline:**
1. **Notify the person who assigned it** as soon as possible
2. **Explain the reason** (competing priorities, complexity, etc.)
3. **Suggest an alternative timeline** that works
4. **Offer to help find solutions** (delegate parts, get additional help, etc.)

### Passing Work to Others

**When you assign work to teammates:**
1. **Provide clear instructions** - assume they know nothing about the context
2. **Include all necessary files** and reference materials
3. **Set realistic deadlines** based on their workload
4. **Specify the deliverable format** you need
5. **Be available for questions**

![Task Handoffs](placeholder-task-handoffs.png)

**Good task assignment example:**
"Please review the Q4 budget draft (attached) and check the marketing section numbers against our approved campaigns. I need your feedback by Thursday at 2 PM for the Friday management presentation. Let me know if you have questions!"

## Managing Team Schedules

### Viewing Team Calendars

**See what your teammates are working on:**
1. **Go to the Team section**
2. **Click on "Team Calendar" or "Team Schedule"**
3. **View by day, week, or month** to see:
   - Who's working on what projects
   - When people have deadlines
   - Who might be available to help
   - Upcoming team meetings or events

### Coordinating Deadlines

**Before setting deadlines:**
- **Check team calendars** for conflicts
- **Consider other project deadlines** that might compete for resources
- **Build in buffer time** for review and revisions
- **Confirm availability** with key team members

**When deadlines conflict:**
- **Talk to your manager** about priorities
- **Negotiate with project stakeholders** if possible
- **Look for ways to spread the work** across more time or people
- **Communicate early** about potential delays

## Supporting Team Members

### Offering Help

**How to be a helpful team member:**
- **Monitor team progress** and offer help when someone seems stuck
- **Share your expertise** when others are learning your skills
- **Take on extra work** when you have capacity and others are overwhelmed
- **Provide feedback** that's constructive and specific

**Ways to offer help:**
- "I have some extra time this week if anyone needs assistance"
- "I've done this type of analysis before - happy to share tips"
- "I can take on the client calls if that would help with your deadline"

### Asking for Help

**When you should ask for help:**
- You don't understand the requirements
- You're behind on a deadline that affects others
- You lack the skills or tools needed
- You're overwhelmed with competing priorities

**How to ask for help effectively:**
1. **Be specific** about what you need help with
2. **Explain what you've already tried** or researched
3. **Suggest how long** you think it will take
4. **Be grateful** and offer to return the favor
5. **Follow up** to confirm the help was useful

## Team Communication Best Practices

### Response Time Expectations

**For urgent items:** Respond within 2-4 hours during business hours
**For normal priority:** Respond within 1 business day
**For low priority:** Respond within 2-3 business days

**When you can't respond immediately:**
- **Acknowledge** that you received the message
- **Give a timeline** for when you'll provide a full response
- **Ask clarifying questions** if needed to provide better help later

### Keeping Everyone Informed

**Share important updates:**
- Changes to project timelines or scope
- New information that affects team decisions
- Completion of major milestones
- Problems that might impact other team members

**Use project updates rather than individual messages** when information affects multiple people

### Managing Disagreements

**When team members disagree:**
1. **Focus on the project goal** rather than personal preferences
2. **Listen to understand** different perspectives
3. **Look for compromises** or alternative solutions
4. **Escalate to your manager** if you can't reach agreement
5. **Stay professional** and respectful throughout

**Extra considerations for remote colleagues:**
- **Be more explicit** in written communications
