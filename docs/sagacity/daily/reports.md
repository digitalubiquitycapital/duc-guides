## Making Reports Look Professional

### Writing Effective Summaries

**Good Example:**
"Completed Q3 budget analysis covering 5 departments. Identified 12% cost savings opportunity in office supplies. Scheduled follow-up meetings with department heads for next week."

**Poor Example:**
"Did budget stuff. Found some savings. More meetings next week."

### Adding Context to Numbers

Instead of just: "Completed 15 tasks"
Write: "Completed 15 tasks including 3 high-priority client requests and 2 important project milestones"

### Highlighting Achievements

**Use action words:**
- Completed, Delivered, Achieved
- Resolved, Improved, Created
- Coordinated, Managed, Led

**Show impact:**
- "Reduced processing time by 30%"
- "Helped client resolve critical issue"
- "Contributed to on-time project delivery"

## Viewing and Understanding Reports

### Reading Your Own Reports

**Look for patterns:**
- Which days are you most productive?
- What types of tasks take longer than expected?
- When do you typically face obstacles?
- What work gives you the most satisfaction?

**Use insights to improve:**
- Schedule difficult tasks during your most productive times
- Ask for help with types of work that consistently challenge you
- Celebrate the work you do well
