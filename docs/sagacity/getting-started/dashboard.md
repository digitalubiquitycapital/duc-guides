# Understanding Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is like your personal office desk - everything you need is right there when you log in. Let's take a tour of what you'll see and how to use it.

## What is the Dashboard?

The dashboard is your main screen in Sagacity. Think of it as your command center where you can:
- See what you need to work on today
- Check messages from your team
- Find tools you use every day
- Get a quick overview of how things are going

## Main Areas of Your Dashboard

### 1. Top Navigation Bar

At the very top of your screen, you'll find:
- **Your name and photo** (top right corner) - click here for your profile
- **Search box** - type anything you're looking for
- **Notifications bell** - shows new messages and updates
- **Settings gear** - adjust your preferences

### 2. Today's Tasks Section

This is usually the biggest section on your screen:

- **To Do Today** - Your list of tasks for today
- **In Progress** - Work you've already started
- **Completed** - Tasks you've finished (great job!)
- **Overdue** - Items that need immediate attention (shown in red)
