# How the Applications Connect

The three applications in our system work together seamlessly to provide you with a complete solution. Think of them as parts of a unified toolkit, each with its own specialty.

## Overview of Connections

### Sagacity (The Data Engine)
- **What it does**: Collects and processes your data
- **How it connects**: Shares processed information with the other applications
- **Your benefit**: Clean, organized data ready for analysis

### Bridge (The Communication Hub)
- **What it does**: Connects different systems and moves data between them
- **How it connects**: Takes data from Sagacity and prepares it for Lift
- **Your benefit**: Smooth data flow without manual intervention

### Lift (The Control Center)
- **What it does**: Provides dashboards and management tools
- **How it connects**: Receives data from Bridge and displays it in easy-to-use interfaces
- **Your benefit**: Clear visibility and control over your operations

## How They Work Together

```
Your Data → Sagacity → Bridge → Lift → You
```

1. **Data Collection**: Sagacity gathers information from your various sources
2. **Data Processing**: Sagacity cleans and organizes the data
3. **Data Transfer**: Bridge moves the processed data securely
4. **Data Presentation**: Lift displays everything in user-friendly dashboards
5. **Your Actions**: You make informed decisions based on clear information
