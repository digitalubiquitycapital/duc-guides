# Single Sign-On Explanation

Single Sign-On (SSO) makes using all three applications simple and secure. Log in once, and access everything you need without entering passwords repeatedly.

## What is Single Sign-On?

### Simple Definition
Single Sign-On means you use one login to access all three applications:
- **Sagacity** (data processing)
- **Bridge** (data connection)
- **Lift** (dashboards and management)

### How It Works
1. **Log in once**: Enter your username and password one time
2. **Access everything**: Move between applications without logging in again
3. **Stay secure**: Your session remains protected across all applications
4. **Log out once**: When you're done, one logout secures everything

## Benefits for You

### Convenience
- **Fewer passwords**: Remember just one set of login credentials
- **Faster access**: No delays switching between applications
- **Seamless experience**: Move between tools without interruption

### Better Security
- **Stronger passwords**: Focus on one strong password instead of many weak ones
- **Centralized control**: Administrators can manage access from one place
- **Automatic logout**: When your session expires, you're logged out of everything

### Time Savings
- **No repeated logins**: Start working immediately
- **Less password recovery**: Fewer forgotten password situations
- **Streamlined workflow**: Focus on your work, not login screens

## How to Use Single Sign-On

### First Time Setup
1. **Receive credentials**: Your administrator provides your login information
2. **Choose strong password**: Create a secure password you'll remember
3. **Test access**: Try logging into each application to confirm everything works

### Daily Use
1. **Log in once**: Start your day by logging into any of the three applications
2. **Switch freely**: Click between Sagacity, Bridge, and Lift without additional logins
3. **Work normally**: Use all features as if they were one application
4. **Log out once**: End your session by logging out of any application

### Switching Applications
- **Direct links**: Click links that take you between applications
- **Browser tabs**: Open multiple applications in different browser tabs
- **Bookmarks**: Save shortcuts to frequently used features
