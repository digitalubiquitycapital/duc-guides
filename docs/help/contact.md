## Support Request Best Practices

### Before You Contact Support

**Gather Information**:
- What were you trying to do?
- What exactly happened or went wrong?
- When did the problem start?
- Are other people having the same issue?
- What browser and operating system are you using?

**Try Basic Steps**:
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try a different browser
- Check if others can access the application

**Document the Issue**:
- Take screenshots of error messages
- Write down exact error text
- Note the time when problems occur
- Record steps to reproduce the issue

### Writing Effective Support Requests

**Subject Line**: Be specific and descriptive
- **Good**: "Sagacity data import failing with CSV files"
- **Bad**: "Help" or "Problem with system"

**Message Body**: Include all relevant details
1. **Brief description** of the problem
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Expected outcome** vs. what actually happened
4. **When it started** and frequency
5. **Your contact information** and preferred response method
6. **Urgency level** and business impact

**Example Good Request**:
```
Subject: Unable to access Lift dashboard - Error 403

Hi Support Team,

I'm unable to access the Lift dashboard as of this morning. When I try to
log in and navigate to the main dashboard, I get an "Error 403: Forbidden"
message.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Log in successfully at [application URL]
2. Click on "Dashboard" in the main menu
3. Error 403 appears instead of dashboard

This started around 9:00 AM today. I was able to access the dashboard
yesterday without issues. I've tried different browsers and clearing
my cache, but the problem persists.

This is affecting my ability to review morning reports for my team.

Best regards,
[Your name]
[Your phone number]
[Your department]
```
