A tool that shows only specific data based on criteria you set. For example, filtering a report to show only last month's sales.

**Firewall**
Security software that protects systems from unauthorized access. Your organization likely has firewalls protecting the applications.

## G

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
The visual elements you interact with in an application - buttons, menus, forms, etc. It's what makes software easy to use without typing commands.

## H

**HTTP/HTTPS**
Protocols used for web communication. HTTPS is the secure version that encrypts data. All our applications use HTTPS for security.

## I

**Integration**
Connecting different systems so they work together seamlessly. Our three applications are integrated to share data and functionality.

**Interface**
The point where you interact with an application - the screens, buttons, and menus you see and use.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
A format for storing and transmitting data. You might see JSON mentioned in technical documentation, but you don't need to understand it to use the applications.

## K

**Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**
An important metric that shows how well something is performing. Dashboards often display KPIs to help you understand business performance.

## L

**Lift**
The application that provides dashboards and management tools. It's where you'll see visual reports and control various aspects of the system.

**Load Balancing**
A technical method that distributes work across multiple servers to ensure good performance. This happens automatically behind the scenes.

**Login Credentials**
Your username and password used to access the applications. Keep these secure and don't share them with others.

## M

**Metadata**
Information about data - like when it was created, who modified it, or what format it's in. The system uses metadata to manage and organize information.

**Migration**
Moving data from one system to another. This might happen when upgrading systems or consolidating information.

## N

**Navigation**
Moving around within an application using menus, links, and buttons. Good navigation helps you find what you need quickly.

**Network**
The system of connected computers that allows applications to communicate. Network issues can cause applications to run slowly or disconnect.

## O

**Offline**
Not connected to the internet or network. Most features require an online connection to work properly.

**Online**
Connected to the internet or network. You need to be online to use the applications and access current data.

## P

**Password Reset**
The process of creating a new password when you forget your current one. Use the "Forgot Password" links on login screens.

**Permissions**
Rules that determine what you can see and do in the applications. Your administrator sets permissions based on your role.

**Portal**
A web page that serves as a starting point for accessing multiple applications or resources. You might use a portal to reach all three applications.

## Q

**Query**
A request for specific information from a database. You might create queries to find particular data or generate custom reports.

**Queue**
A line of tasks waiting to be processed. Data processing jobs often wait in queues during busy periods.

## R

**Real-time**
Information that updates immediately as changes occur. Many dashboards show real-time data so you always see current information.

**Report**
A formatted presentation of data, often including charts, tables, and analysis. You can generate reports from any of the applications.

**Role**
Your position or function in the organization, which determines what you can access and do in the applications.

## S

**Sagacity**
The application that collects and processes data. It's the starting point where raw information becomes useful, organized data.

**Server**
A computer that provides services to other computers. Our applications run on servers hosted in secure data centers.

**Session**
The period from when you log in until you log out. Sessions automatically end after periods of inactivity for security.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**
A system that lets you log in once to access multiple applications. You can move between Sagacity, Bridge, and Lift without logging in repeatedly.

**Synchronization**
