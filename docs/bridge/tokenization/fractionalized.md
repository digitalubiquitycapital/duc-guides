# Fractionalized Asset Tokenization

Fractionalized tokenization enables multiple investors to own portions of high-value assets that would typically be accessible only to wealthy individuals or institutions. By dividing expensive assets into smaller, tradeable digital tokens, Bridge creates new investment opportunities while maintaining proportional ownership rights and benefits for all participants.

## Understanding Fractionalization

Fractionalized tokenization breaks down the ownership of a single high-value asset into multiple digital tokens, each representing a fractional ownership interest. This approach democratizes access to premium assets while preserving the economic and legal rights associated with ownership.

### Core Concept

**Traditional Limitation:** Many valuable assets require substantial capital commitments that exclude smaller investors from participation. A commercial property worth $10 million, for example, typically requires institutional-level investment capacity.

**Fractionalized Solution:** The same $10 million property can be divided into 10,000 tokens worth $1,000 each, enabling broader investor participation while maintaining proportional rights to income, appreciation, and decision-making.

**Economic Alignment:** Token holders receive benefits proportional to their ownership percentage, including:
- Income distributions
- Capital appreciation
- Voting rights
- Liquidation proceeds
- Tax advantages

## Legal Structure and Framework

### Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Formation

**Entity Selection:**
Fractionalized assets typically require an SPV to hold legal title and facilitate token holder rights:

- **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** Provides operational flexibility and tax pass-through benefits
- **Delaware Statutory Trust (DST):** Offers favorable tax treatment and investor protection
- **Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT):** Enables public market access with specific requirements
- **Limited Partnership (LP):** Provides management structure and liability protection

**Governance Structure:**
- Management company or general partner oversight
- Token holder voting rights and procedures
- Advisory committee participation
- Major decision thresholds and approval processes
- Conflict resolution and dispute mechanisms

### Ownership Rights Definition

**Proportional Rights:**
Token holders receive rights proportional to their ownership percentage:

| Token Holdings | Ownership % | Monthly Income | Voting Power | Liquidation Rights |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 100 tokens     | 1%         | 1% of distributions | 1% of votes | 1% of proceeds |
| 500 tokens     | 5%         | 5% of distributions | 5% of votes | 5% of proceeds |
| 1,000 tokens   | 10%        | 10% of distributions | 10% of votes | 10% of proceeds |

**Reserved Rights:**
Certain decisions may require special approval thresholds:
- Major capital expenditures (75% approval)
- Asset disposition (80% approval)
- Management changes (66% approval)
- Refinancing decisions (60% approval)
- Distribution policy changes (majority approval)

### Securities Regulation Compliance

**Investment Contract Analysis:**
Fractionalized tokens typically qualify as securities under the Howey Test:
1. Investment of money
2. Common enterprise
3. Expectation of profits
4. Efforts of others

**Registration Requirements:**
- Securities Act registration or exemption
- State blue sky law compliance
- Investment Company Act considerations

**Common Exemptions:**

```solidity
contract FractionalAssetToken {
    // Token metadata and supply
    string public name;
    string public symbol;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    
    // Asset information
    address public assetAddress;
    uint256 public assetValue;
    uint256 public lastValuation;
    
    // Distribution tracking
    mapping(address => uint256) public distributions;
    uint256 public totalDistributions;
    
    // Compliance integration
    address public complianceContract;
    
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(isQualifiedInvestor(to), "Recipient not qualified");
        require(complianceCheck(msg.sender, to, amount), "Transfer restricted");
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
    
    function distribute() external onlyManager {
        uint256 totalIncome = getAssetIncome();
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < holders.length; i++) {
            uint256 holderShare = (balanceOf(holders[i]) * totalIncome) / totalSupply;
            _distributeToHolder(holders[i], holderShare);
        }
    }
}
```

**Governance Contract:**
```solidity

    struct Proposal {
        uint256 id;

        uint256 votesAgainst;
        uint256 endTime;
        bool executed;
        ProposalType proposalType;
    }
    
    enum ProposalType {
        Management,
        CapitalExpenditure,
        Distribution,
        Disposition
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;
    
    function submitProposal(
        string memory description,
        ProposalType proposalType
    ) external onlyTokenHolder returns (uint256) {
        uint256 proposalId = nextProposalId++;
        proposals[proposalId] = Proposal({
            id: proposalId,
            description: description,
            votesFor: 0,
            votesAgainst: 0,
            endTime: block.timestamp + votingPeriod,
            executed: false,
            proposalType: proposalType
        });
        return proposalId;
    }
    
    function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) external {
        require(tokenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender) > 0, "No voting power");
        require(!hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender], "Already voted");
        
        uint256 votingPower = tokenContract.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        
        if (support) {
            proposals[proposalId].votesFor += votingPower;
        } else {
            proposals[proposalId].votesAgainst += votingPower;
