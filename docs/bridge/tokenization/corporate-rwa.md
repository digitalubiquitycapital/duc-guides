# Corporate Real-World Asset Tokenization

Corporate Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization represents the digitization of traditional business assets and financial instruments, creating blockchain-based representations of corporate securities, debt instruments, and operational assets. This approach enables corporations to access new funding sources, enhance liquidity, and modernize their capital structures while maintaining regulatory compliance and investor protections.

## Understanding Corporate RWA Tokenization

Corporate RWA tokenization transforms traditional corporate assets into digital tokens that represent legal ownership rights, economic interests, or contractual claims. Unlike retail-focused tokenization, corporate RWA focuses on institutional-grade assets and professional investor markets, requiring sophisticated compliance frameworks and governance structures.

### Key Characteristics

**Institutional Focus:** Corporate RWA tokenization targets sophisticated investors including pension funds, insurance companies, family offices, and qualified institutional buyers who understand complex investment structures.

**Regulatory Sophistication:** Corporate tokens must comply with extensive securities regulations, corporate governance requirements, and institutional investor protection standards.

**Professional Management:** Corporate RWA requires experienced management teams, professional service providers, and institutional-grade operational infrastructure.

**Scale and Complexity:** Corporate tokenization projects typically involve larger asset values, more complex structures, and longer-term investment horizons than retail-focused initiatives.

        string jurisdiction;
    }
    
    struct Dividend {
        uint256 recordDate;
        uint256 paymentDate;
        uint256 amountPerShare;
        bool isPaid;
        mapping(address => bool) claimed;
    }
    
    mapping(address => Shareholder) public shareholders;
    mapping(uint256 => Dividend) public dividends;
    
    event DividendDeclared(uint256 indexed dividendId, uint256 recordDate, uint256 paymentDate, uint256 amount);
    event DividendPaid(address indexed shareholder, uint256 amount);
    
    function declareDividend(
        uint256 recordDate,

            recordDate: recordDate,
            paymentDate: paymentDate,
            amountPerShare: amountPerShare,
            isPaid: false
        });
        emit DividendDeclared(dividendId, recordDate, paymentDate, amountPerShare);
    }
    
    function claimDividend(uint256 dividendId) external {
        require(shareholders[msg.sender].shares > 0, "Not a shareholder");
        require(block.timestamp >= dividends[dividendId].paymentDate, "Payment date not reached");
        require(!dividends[dividendId].claimed[msg.sender], "Dividend already claimed");
        
        uint256 dividendAmount = shareholders[msg.sender].shares * dividends[dividendId].amountPerShare;
        dividends[dividendId].claimed[msg.sender] = true;

        payable(msg.sender).transfer(dividendAmount);
