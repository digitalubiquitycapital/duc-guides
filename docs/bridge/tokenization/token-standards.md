# Token Standards for Asset Tokenization

Token standards provide the technical foundation for asset tokenization, defining how digital tokens behave, interact, and maintain compliance within blockchain ecosystems. Bridge supports multiple token standards to accommodate different asset types, regulatory requirements, and investor needs while ensuring interoperability and security across platforms.

## Understanding Token Standards

Token standards are technical specifications that define the interface and behavior of blockchain-based tokens. These standards ensure compatibility between different applications, wallets, and exchanges while providing the necessary functionality for regulatory compliance, asset management, and investor protection.

### Importance of Standards

**Interoperability:** Standardized tokens can work seamlessly across different platforms, wallets, and applications without custom integration work.

**Security:** Established standards have been thoroughly tested and audited, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Security token standards include built-in compliance features that help issuers meet regulatory requirements automatically.

**Market Adoption:** Standard-compliant tokens can easily integrate with existing infrastructure, improving liquidity and accessibility.

## ERC-20: The Foundation Standard

ERC-20 (Ethereum Request for Comments 20) is the most widely adopted token standard, providing basic functionality for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Core Functions

**Essential Methods:**
```solidity
interface IERC20 {
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fungible tokens (each token is identical and interchangeable)
- Simple transfer and approval mechanisms
- Wide ecosystem support
- Basic event logging
- No built-in compliance features

### Limitations for Securities

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- No built-in transfer restrictions
- Limited investor verification capabilities
- No automated compliance enforcement
- Insufficient reporting mechanisms
- Limited corporate action support

**Workarounds for Asset Tokenization:**
While ERC-20 lacks native compliance features, Bridge implements additional smart contracts to add:
- Transfer restriction enforcement
- Investor whitelisting
- KYC/AML verification
- Automated compliance reporting
- Corporate action management

## ERC-1400: The Security Token Standard

ERC-1400 was specifically designed for security tokens, providing comprehensive functionality for regulated asset tokenization with built-in compliance and governance features.

### Enhanced Security Token Features

**Document Management:**
```solidity
interface IERC1400 {
    // Document management
    function getDocument(bytes32 name) external view returns (string memory, bytes32);
    function setDocument(bytes32 name, string calldata uri, bytes32 documentHash) external;
    
    // Transfer validation
    function canTransfer(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) 
        external view returns (bytes1, bytes32);
    
    // Forced transfers (for compliance)
    function controllerTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 value, 
        bytes calldata data, bytes calldata operatorData) external;
    
    // Token issuance and redemption
    function issue(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
    function redeem(uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
    function redeemFrom(address from, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

**Partition Management:**
ERC-1400 supports token partitions, allowing different classes of tokens within a single contract:

```solidity
interface IERC1400Partition {
    function balanceOfByPartition(bytes32 partition, address tokenHolder) 
        external view returns (uint256);
    
    function transferByPartition(bytes32 partition, address to, uint256 value, 
        bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes32);
    
    function authorizeOperatorByPartition(bytes32 partition, address operator) external;
    function revokeOperatorByPartition(bytes32 partition, address operator) external;
}
```

### Compliance Integration

**Transfer Restrictions:**
- Automated investor verification
- Jurisdiction-based restrictions
- Time-based lock-ups
- Volume limitations
- Accreditation requirements

**Corporate Actions:**
- Dividend distributions
- Stock splits and combinations
- Voting and governance
- Rights offerings
- Merger and acquisition support

## ERC-1410: Partially Fungible Tokens

ERC-1410 provides a foundation for ERC-1400, offering partially fungible token functionality that allows different tranches or classes within a single token contract.

### Tranche Management

**Tranche Structure:**
```solidity
interface IERC1410 {
    function balanceOfByTranche(bytes32 tranche, address tokenHolder) 
        external view returns (uint256);
    
    function tranchesOf(address tokenHolder) external view returns (bytes32[] memory);
    
    function transferByTranche(bytes32 tranche, address to, uint256 value, 
        bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes32);
    
    function authorizeOperatorByTranche(bytes32 tranche, address operator) external;
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Different investor classes (accredited vs. non-accredited)
- Various lock-up periods
- Distinct voting rights
- Separate distribution rights
- Geographic restrictions

## ERC-721: Non-Fungible Tokens

ERC-721 enables the creation of unique, non-fungible tokens suitable for representing individual assets or unique ownership rights.

### Unique Asset Representation

**Core Interface:**
```solidity
interface IERC721 {
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address owner);
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address operator);
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

**Asset Tokenization Applications:**
- Individual real estate properties
- Unique art pieces and collectibles
- Intellectual property rights
- Equipment and machinery
- Specialized investment vehicles

### Metadata and Attributes

**Token Metadata:**
```solidity
interface IERC721Metadata {
    function name() external view returns (string memory);

## ERC-1155: Multi-Token Standard

ERC-1155 provides a unified interface for both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract, offering gas efficiency and operational flexibility.

### Hybrid Token Functionality

**Multi-Token Interface:**
```solidity
interface IERC1155 {
    function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata accounts, uint256[] calldata ids) 
        external view returns (uint256[] memory);
    
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address account, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, 
        bytes calldata data) external;
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] calldata ids, 
        uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

    struct ComplianceRule {
        bytes32 ruleId;
        bool isActive;
        uint256 maxHolders;
        uint256 maxTokensPerHolder;
        mapping(string => bool) allowedJurisdictions;
        uint256 minHoldingPeriod;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => ComplianceRule) public complianceRules;
    mapping(address => uint256) public investorAcquisitionTime;
    mapping(address => bool) public accreditedInvestors;
    
    function validateTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) 
        internal view returns (bool) {
        // Check holder limits
        if (holderCount >= complianceRules[currentRule].maxHolders && balanceOf(to) == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check per-holder limits
        if (balanceOf(to) + amount > complianceRules[currentRule].maxTokensPerHolder) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check holding period
        if (block.timestamp < investorAcquisitionTime[from] + 
            complianceRules[currentRule].minHoldingPeriod) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check jurisdiction restrictions
        string memory investorJurisdiction = getInvestorJurisdiction(to);
        if (!complianceRules[currentRule].allowedJurisdictions[investorJurisdiction]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Advanced Corporate Actions:**
```solidity
contract BridgeCorporateActions {
    struct Dividend {
        uint256 recordDate;
        uint256 paymentDate;
        uint256 amountPerToken;
        bool isPaid;
        mapping(address => bool) claimed;
    }
    
    struct StockSplit {
        uint256 effectiveDate;
        uint256 splitRatio; // e.g., 200 for 2:1 split
        bool executed;
    }
    
    function declareDividend(uint256 recordDate, uint256 paymentDate, 
        uint256 amountPerToken) external onlyAuthorized {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    function executeStockSplit(uint256 splitRatio) external onlyAuthorized {
        // Implementation with automatic token adjustment
    }
    
    function processSpinoff(address newTokenContract, uint256 ratio) 
        external onlyAuthorized {
        // Implementation for corporate spinoffs
    }
}
```
