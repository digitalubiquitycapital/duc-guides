# Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Setup and Management

Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) serve as the legal foundation for asset tokenization projects, providing the necessary corporate structure to hold assets, issue tokens, and manage investor relationships while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational efficiency. Bridge's SPV framework enables seamless tokenization while protecting all stakeholders through established legal structures and governance mechanisms.

## Understanding SPVs in Tokenization

An SPV is a separate legal entity created specifically to hold and manage tokenized assets, isolate risks, and facilitate investor participation. The SPV serves as the bridge between traditional asset ownership and digital token representation, ensuring that token holders have legitimate ownership rights while maintaining compliance with securities and corporate law.

### Core Functions of SPVs

**Asset Ownership:** The SPV holds legal title to the underlying asset, whether real estate, securities, or other investment vehicles, ensuring clear chain of title and ownership rights.

**Token Issuance:** The SPV issues digital tokens that represent fractional ownership interests in the SPV and, by extension, the underlying assets.

**Investor Relations:** The SPV manages relationships with token holders, including distributions, communications, voting, and compliance requirements.

**Regulatory Compliance:** The SPV ensures ongoing compliance with securities laws, tax regulations, and industry-specific requirements.

**Risk Isolation:** The SPV structure protects both the underlying asset and the sponsor from liabilities associated with the tokenization project.
