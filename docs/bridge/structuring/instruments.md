        external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 bondBalance = balanceOf(bondholder);
        uint256 annualCoupon = (bondBalance * bondTerms.couponRate) / 10000;
        return annualCoupon / (12 / bondTerms.paymentFrequency);
    }
    
    function declareCouponPayment(uint256 paymentDate) external onlyIssuer {
        uint256 paymentId = nextPaymentId++;
        uint256 totalCouponAmount = calculateTotalCouponPayment();
        
        couponPayments[paymentId] = CouponPayment({
            paymentDate: paymentDate,
            amount: totalCouponAmount,
            isPaid: false
        });
    }
    
    function claimCoupon(uint256 paymentId) external {
        require(!couponPayments[paymentId].claimed[msg.sender], "Coupon already claimed");
        require(couponPayments[paymentId].isPaid, "Payment not processed");
        
        uint256 couponAmount = calculateCouponPayment(msg.sender);
        couponPayments[paymentId].claimed[msg.sender] = true;
        
        // Transfer coupon payment
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(couponAmount);
        emit CouponPaid(msg.sender, couponAmount, couponPayments[paymentId].paymentDate);
    }
}
```

    mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public tierHoldings;
    
    function updateAssetPool(
        uint256 collections,
        uint256 chargeOffs,
        uint256 prepayments
    ) external onlyServicer {
        assetPool.currentBalance = assetPool.currentBalance + collections - chargeOffs - prepayments;
        calculateWaterfallDistribution(collections);
    }
    
    function calculateWaterfallDistribution(uint256 availableFunds) internal {
        uint256 remainingFunds = availableFunds;
        
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < waterfallTiers.length; i++) {
            WaterfallTier memory tier = waterfallTiers[i];
            uint256 tierPayment;
            
            if (tier.isFixed) {
                tierPayment = tier.rate;
            } else {
                uint256 tierBalance = getTierOutstandingBalance(i);
                tierPayment = (tierBalance * tier.rate) / 10000;
            }
            
            if (tierPayment <= remainingFunds) {
                distributionAmounts[i] = tierPayment;
                remainingFunds -= tierPayment;
            } else {
                distributionAmounts[i] = remainingFunds;
                remainingFunds = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

        uint256 liquidationPreference;
        bool hasParticipationRights;
        bool isConvertible;
        uint256 conversionRatio;
    }
    
    struct Proposal {
        uint256 proposalId;
        string description;
        uint256 votingDeadline;
        uint256 votesFor;
        uint256 votesAgainst;
        uint256 votesAbstain;
        bool isExecuted;
        uint256 requiredMajority;
    }
    
    mapping(bytes32 => ShareClass) public shareClasses;
    mapping(uint256 => Proposal) public proposals;
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public hasVoted;
    
    function submitVote(
        uint256 proposalId,
        uint8 voteChoice, // 0: Against, 1: For, 2: Abstain
        bytes32 shareClass
    ) external {
        require(!hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender], "Already voted");
        require(block.timestamp <= proposals[proposalId].votingDeadline, "Voting closed");
        
        uint256 votingPower = balanceOf(msg.sender, shareClass) * 
                             shareClasses[shareClass].votesPerShare;
        
        if (voteChoice == 0) {
            proposals[proposalId].votesAgainst += votingPower;
        } else if (voteChoice == 1) {
            proposals[proposalId].votesFor += votingPower;
        } else {
            proposals[proposalId].votesAbstain += votingPower;
        }
        
        hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function executeProposal(uint256 proposalId) external {
        Proposal storage proposal = proposals[proposalId];
        require(block.timestamp > proposal.votingDeadline, "Voting still active");
        require(!proposal.isExecuted, "Already executed");
        
        uint256 totalVotes = proposal.votesFor + proposal.votesAgainst;
        uint256 approvalPercentage = (proposal.votesFor * 100) / totalVotes;
        
        require(approvalPercentage >= proposal.requiredMajority, "Insufficient approval");
        
        proposal.isExecuted = true;
        // Execute proposal logic
    }
}
```

### Convertible Securities

        uint256 conversionPrice;
        uint256 conversionStart;
        uint256 conversionEnd;
        bool hasAntiDilution;
        uint256 currentConversionRatio;
    }
    
    ConversionTerms public conversionTerms;
    address public commonStockContract;
    
    function convertToBond(uint256 bondAmount) external {
        require(bondAmount <= balanceOf(msg.sender), "Insufficient bonds");
        require(block.timestamp >= conversionTerms.conversionStart, "Conversion not started");
        require(block.timestamp <= conversionTerms.conversionEnd, "Conversion expired");
        
        uint256 commonShares = bondAmount * conversionTerms.currentConversionRatio;
        
        // Burn convertible bonds
        _burn(msg.sender, bondAmount);
        
        // Issue common stock
        ICommonStock(commonStockContract).mint(msg.sender, commonShares);
        
        emit ConversionExecuted(msg.sender, bondAmount, commonShares);
    }
    
    function adjustConversionRatio(
        uint256 newShares,
        uint256 pricePerShare,
        uint256 sharesOutstanding
    ) external onlyIssuer {
        if (!conversionTerms.hasAntiDilution) return;
        
        uint256 oldConversionPrice = 1e18 / conversionTerms.currentConversionRatio;
        uint256 weightedAveragePrice = (
            (sharesOutstanding * oldConversionPrice) + (newShares * pricePerShare)
        ) / (sharesOutstanding + newShares);
        
        conversionTerms.currentConversionRatio = 1e18 / weightedAveragePrice;
    }
}
```
